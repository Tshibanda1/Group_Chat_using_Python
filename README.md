This is a group chat using socket programming and python.This was a very interesting project to work on I really enjoyed it! Hope you enjoy using it! *

To use note the following:
In order for group chat to work members must be connected to the same WIFI
If you want to make it work over WAN you can change the IP address in the server to use the public IP address
There are 2 python files (Server and client)
Run the server file first (This will act as the host) *Then run the client file(can be run on a seperate computer) to run on same computer multiple times you can use the cmd *While entering chat provide a username and you are good to go! *The server is responsible for managing communication
SCREENSHOTS SHOWN BELOW: (I implemented a basic GUI), interaction between two members only, can be extended to use much as you like:
